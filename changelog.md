To my portfolio website on syptic.github.io, I added Google analytics.
To match the css edit to imgs, I added background music.
Furthermore, I made a few tweaks so the styling was consistent all around and I am working on using javascript to change my website to SPA where only the main section changes since everything else remains same.
Made tweaks to Spike's images on home page and made the navbar more coherent.
I also added the blogs to my exists who page.
Working on adding site in-search using Google search.
