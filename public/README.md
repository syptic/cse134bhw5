### Welcome to my personal website ###
Note - part 3 has been done on why.html not crud.html
From changelog.md:
To my portfolio website on syptic.github.io, I added Google analytics.
To match the css edit to imgs, I added background music to the home page with audio-controls.
Made tweaks to Spike's images on home page and made the navbar more coherent.
Added site in-search using Google search(currently still working to improve it to search items within the site more accurately).
Used different modules for Part 1 to ensure coherent, easy to read and re-usable code.
Use display flex for the navbar and removed max-width so adding new items to top nav doesn't affect it.
Organized my code into different files and managed assets much better.
I also added the blogs to my existing why page and then implemented Part 3 in it.
Added a seperate css file for blogs and user auth. 
Got decution in part 1 for minor div-itis so distributed code into different sections and used better tags such as details, menu and article to coherently divide the code and make better usage of existing HTML tags.
Improved css, used standard colors across the website with contrast for better readbility and management.
Improved lightHouse score to 100s and high 90s. Made fixes such as adding aria-labels, providing image dimenions and only importing firebase modules as needed.
Also added favicon.ico to better represent my website.
